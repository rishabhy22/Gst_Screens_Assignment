# GST Search Screens Assignment

- As asked in assignment, first screen enables searches for gstin from an api, 
and second screen shows details fetched using provided gstin.

- To make app functional a mock api is built using Firebase which returns required
information when provided with gstin number.

## Data Generation for mock api

A python script was written to randomly generate information like addresses, organization
name, dates, etc. for a particular gstin number, which itself was also generated randomly by
the that script.

Link to github repository of the Python Script :

> [GST Search Screens Random Data Generator](https://github.com/rishabhy22/Gst_Search_Screens_GstInGenerator)

## Generted GSTIN numbers

This repository, as well as Data Generation repository, both contain a text file named
"[gstINs.txt](https://github.com/rishabhy22/Gst_Screens_Assignment/blob/main/gstINs.txt)" which contains valid gstin numbers that were generated by above mentioned [Python Script](https://github.com/rishabhy22/Gst_Search_Screens_GstInGenerator/blob/main/main.py) and were stored in Firebase firestore database along with other information generated to build a mock api. Gstin Numbers other than those will be considered invalid.
